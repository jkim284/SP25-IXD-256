# Mercedes-Benz Desk Lamp


## Concept
This product is a lamp designed for Mecedes-Benz to help lighten up and decorate your desk. The product itself is quite heavy, so it is not really meant to be moved aorund often. It is made of a total of 4 clear acrylic disks, and a piece of MDF board to supprt the bottom. Another core component of this product is the flat pedestal placed at the bottom of the lmap that helps trigger it's stages.

## Stages

### Stage 1 
This is the resting or 'idle' state that the lamp is in. The lamp rests on top of the flat pedestal, and all LED lights are off.

### Stage 2
This is the 'on' stage. WHen you lift the lamp and move it of the pedestal, it will trigger the LED strip and turn on. This allows the lamp to emit a soft white glow around the edge of the rim. 

### Stage 3
The final stage is tiggered once the 'on' stage sets off. Once the 'on' stage is activated, after a few seconds, the lights will start pulsing in a soft, rhythmic flow for the user to enjoy. 

### Stage 4
Once you feel the need to turn off the lamp, simply lift it up, and place it back on the pedestal, and it will turn off.
