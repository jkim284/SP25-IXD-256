# Concert Bracelet

## Concept
This product is a bracelet designed for concerts to provide a fun way to further immerse yourself with the artist when he/ she is performing. The product is an LED strip in the shape of a bracelet to put on your wrist, and it's meant to be light and simple so it doesn't get in the way while you are having fun. It also has a motion sensor that you keep in your hand so that the color can change based on the movement of your wrist. The bracelet has two colors for the purpose of this assignment - BLACK and RED, but you can program it to have any range of colors.
